    //domain name refers to .com, .ca etc
    
    //Since our content is a string, varchar, we can use a substring function to find 
    //string values within it
        //specifically the substring_index function
        
    //the substring_index function takes a string, a delimiter, and a count as its parameters
        //string, the string from which the function will extract a substring
        //delimiter, the barrier/marker/character that the function will find
        //count, refers to the number of delimiters present
            //if count is positive then it will take the substring to the left of the delimiter
            //negative will go to the right
    
    //substring_index can use the substring from another substring_index function 
        //to create two, or more, barriers
        //obviously only two barriers if they have opposite counts, a + and a -
